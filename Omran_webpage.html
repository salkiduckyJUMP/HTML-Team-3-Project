<h1>Pork Roast (Just Kidding!)</h1>
<!-- HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag. -->
<p>Hi!  I am Omran Losinno and I am the chef!  This page will be showing off how to cook and prepare a delicious fake pork roast.  Not fully fake pork, it uses bacon to secure a soft and delicious mixture that will leave you wanting more.</p>

<!-- This is the ingredients list. It is unordered.--> 
<h2>Required Ingredients</h2>
<!-- An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. -->
<ul>

<li>Butter.  I suggest 2 tablespoons unsalted (30ml), but you could always use more.</li>
<li>2 packs of thick-cut bacon.</li>
<li>1 Cup, or 250ml of red wine.  We use Pinot Noir as it's preferable for cooking.</li>
<li>1/4 Cup, or 60ml of sake.  Any sake that is labeled as “sweet” such as mirin should do.</li>
<li>2 tbsp(s), or 30ml of soy sauce.</li>

<div class="stages">
    <h2>Prep Work</h2>
    <p>Before anything else in cooking, one must perform the preparation needed to cook.  Wash your hands, sharpen your knives on your whetstone and let's begin!</p>
    <progress value="0" max="100"></progress>
</div>
<ol>
<li><p>Peel the Potatoes.  Grab your potatoes and peel most skin off of all six white potatoes.</p></li>
<li><p>Slice the Potatoes.  Rinse the potatoes in water, then cut them into quarters or halves depending on size.</p></li>
<li><p>Chop the mushrooms and onions into equally-sized Brunoise (pronounced BROON-wahz) (small 5-6 centimeter (1-2 inch) cubes.</p></li>
<!-- HTML New Element progress can be used to help estimate recipe progress! -->
<div class="stages">
    <h2>Mash Make</h2>
    <p>With our needed knife work completed, we may now proceed with creating the core of our pseudo-roast.</p>
    <progress value="15" max="100"></progress>
</div>
<li><p>Boil the Potatoes.  Boil or steam potatoes until soft which should take about 15-20 minutes.  DO NOT steam or microwave mushrooms or onions, rather proceed to next step.</p></li>
<li><p>Pan Fry the Onions and Mushrooms.  Prepare a frying pan with a tbsp of butter.  Sweat onions and pan fry mushrooms until carmelized or fully golden.</p></li>
<li><p>Mash the Potatoes.  Mash into small chunks in a large bowl.  Do not mash too much, you want to prevent it from getting frothy in order to shape it properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Combine the Mushroom and Onion Mixture with the Potato Mash.  Mix until the ingredients are even in the bowl.</p></li>
<li><p>Pluck the Rosemary.  Pick the rosemary off its stem, then set aside.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the Salt.  Sprinkle a bit of salt atop the bowl mixture.  Remember that this dish uses bacon which is already salty.</p></li>
<div class="stages">
    <h2>Form Roast</h2>
    <p>This is the hardest part of the recipe: forming and wrapping the fake pork roast.</p>
    <progress value="35" max="100"></progress>
</div>
<li><p>Form the Fake Roast.  CAUTION: HOT!  Let the mix cool until you can safely touch it - should take over 5 minutes.  Take all of your mix and form it into a log or football shape.</p></li>

         var c = document.getElementById('newCanvas');
         var context = c.getContext('2d');
         var cX = 0;
         var cY = 25;
         var radius = 30;
         
         context.save();
         context.translate(c.width / 2, c.height / 5);
         context.scale(2, 1);
         context.beginPath();
         context.arc(cX, cY, radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI, false);
         context.restore();
         context.fillStyle = '#8c0000';
         context.fill();
         context.lineWidth = 2;
         context.strokeStyle = 'orange';
         context.stroke();

<li><p>Wrap the Roast in Bacon.  This is the most difficult step.  Using both packs of thick-cut bacon, wrap the roast fully.  Try not to leave any gaps, otherwise the potato mixture will seep out when the bacon tightens.  I suggest using a hand-knit bacon weave to create a bacon net.</p></li>
<li><p>Tie the Roast.  Tie the roast with the twine.  It doesn’t need to be anything fancy, just wrap it around a few times.  Don't tug it too tightly!  Intertwine the rosemary afterward, tucking it between twine.  Rosemary grants your fake roast a delightful fragrance.</p></li>
<li><p>Bake in the Oven.  Bake at 375ºF or 190ºC for 40-50 minutes or until bacon is crispy, turning over once halfway.  (Tip: crank heat up during last ten minutes to make bacon extra-crispy!)</p></li>
<div class="stages">
    <h2>Create Sauce</h2>
    <p>Time to make the sauce!  Start this step about ten minutes after turning over the fake roast.</p>
    <progress value="60" max="100"></progress>
</div>
<li><p>Boil the Wine In the Frying Pan.  Bring the wine to a boil (~10 minutes) on medium-high heat in a frying pan.  The goal is to reduce it.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the Butter, Sake, and Soy Sauce to the Wine.  Melt the butter into the boiling wine, then pour the soy sauce and sake into the sauce.  Continue to cook for 2-3 minutes.</p></li>
<div class="stages">
    <h2>Prepare To Serve</h2>
    <p>Congratulations, you're done cooking!  Now to make the meal presentable and serve it.</p>

<li><p>Remove the Twine and the Rosemary.  Once baking is done, remove twine and rosemary - they are not to be eaten.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare Fake Roast.  Since this is a fake pork roast there isn't a waiting period to retain juices.  Move fake roast atop a big plate or cutting board.  Cut a few slices off initially, then move it onto a big plate.  Slowly pour sauce all over your fake roast.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the Garnish.  Add your chosen garnish atop the dish.  I suggested parsley, but use what you want.</p></li>
<li><p>Serve!  Move your fake roast to sit on a big plate.  Drizzle sauce atop the roast when served.</p></li>
